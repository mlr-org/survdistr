Description: Provides efficient containers for storing and managing prediction outputs 
    of survival models, such as Cox proportional hazards, random survival forests, 
    and other classical or modern machine learning-based survival estimators.
    Container for single-event setting, competing risks and multi-state setting. 
    Optimized for performance and usability in survival analysis workflows, the package includes 
    fast methods for evaluating survival probabilities, cumulative hazard functions, 
    probability density functions, and more at given time points. 
    Provides several interpolation methods. 
    An easy-to-use interface for managing predictions and applying post-processing methods.
